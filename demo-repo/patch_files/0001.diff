Certainly! To handle edge cases, we need to consider what the function should return for cases like `x = 0`, and potentially any other special cases you have in mind. For simplicity, let's assume you want to handle `x = 0` as a separate case. The update might look like this:

1. Recognize `x = 0` as a distinct edge case.
2. Ensure function properly handles negative, zero, and positive values.

Here's the patch for your file:

```patch
0001: def foo(x):
0002:     if x < 0:
0003:         return "negative"
0004:     elif x == 0:
0005:         return "zero"
0006:     else:
0007:         return "positive"
```

This patch updates the `foo` function to handle the edge case where `x` is zero.
